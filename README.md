## Hi!

Welcome to Toronto AI!


To get started with scikit, you'll need a python 3.6 environment with scikit, jupyter and some other libraries.  You can get all of this in one download [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads){target: '_blank'}.  Choose the 3.6 version.


Do you have it installed?  Ok!  The next step is to clone this repository, which contains the example we'll be using.  To clone this repository, open your terminal/command prompt and type:

```git clone https://github.com/toronto-ai/workshops.git```

If you don't have git installed, you can find it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads){target: '_blank'}

Now, once you have it cloned, go into that folder and type

```jupyter notebook```

You're ready to go!
